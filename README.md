## Hi there  my name YuliiaðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m thrilled to embark on this exciting journey into Front-End development! With over 10 years of experience as a croupier, Iâ€™ve cultivated exceptional interpersonal skills and thrived as part of a dynamic casino team, sharpening my ability to work collaboratively. This background has given me a strong foundation in soft skills, such as communication and teamwork. My superpower has always been my quick adaptability and ability to learn new things swiftly, traits that have been with me since childhood.
Currently, Iâ€™m focused on building my programming expertise and expanding my hard skills as I progress further in this domain. I also have several projects that you can check below.
