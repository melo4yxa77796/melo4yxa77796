## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, my name is Yuliia

Iâ€™m thrilled to embark on this exciting journey into Web Development and Data Analytics!  
With over 10 years of experience as a croupier, Iâ€™ve cultivated exceptional interpersonal skills and thrived as part of a dynamic international casino team, sharpening my ability to work collaboratively.  
This background has given me a strong foundation in soft skills such as communication, teamwork, adaptability, and stress resistance.  
My superpower has always been quick adaptability and a strong ability to learn new skills swiftly, traits that have been with me since childhood.

Currently, Iâ€™m focused on building my programming expertise and expanding my hard skills as I progress further in this domain.  
I also have several projects that you can check below.
